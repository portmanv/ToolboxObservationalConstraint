# Installation 
Install anaconda https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/
Open anaconda Navigator
In Environments, create a new environment named for example toolbox. In this step I chose python version 3.9.19.

Go to the tab "Home". Make sure you use "toolbox", indicated on the top. Click on "Install" on Jupyter Notebook.

Click on "Launch" on Jupyter Notebook. A tab should open on your browser. Open the "ToolboxObservationalConstraint" file, go to /notebook, and run "Part1_install_packages" to install all needed packages.
